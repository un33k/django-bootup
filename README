A Django  application that helps with quick and secure bootup of your django project".
``Bootup takes care of your repetitive tasks of running a clean project.``

Current Features:
_________________

1. Disable ``syncdb`` from prompting you to create a superuser

2. Latch on the ``post_syncdb`` signal and execute the following:
    A. Install all ``fixture(s)`` found within a given path (single path)
        * - Path is set in your settings file as: INITIAL_FIXTURES_DIRS
        * _ Any valid fixture file(s) at the above path will be installed
        * _ Fixture files(s) at the above path don't require to start with ``initial_``
        * _ Fixture installation will be skipped if no fixture file is found at the specified path
        * _ Fixture installation will be skipped if INITIAL_FIXTURES_DIRS is not defined or empty

    B. Create or Update a superuser
        * - This superuser will be the first created user on your system
        * - Primary Key = ``1`` will be used to fetch and update existing superuser
        * - Superuser credentials have to be set in the project's settings file as follows:
          + ADMIN_NAME = "desired name for the superuser"
          + MAIN_PASS = "desired password for ``the`` superuser"
          + ADMIN_EMAIL = "desired email address for the superuser"
        * _ Superuser creation/update will be skipped if:
          + Any of the three (above) credentials is undefined or empty

    C. Automatically create the required ``Site`` objects with proper ``name`` and ``domain`` if:
        * _ Existence of SITE_INFO in your setting file with the following format
        # -------------------------------
        SITE_INFO = {
            '1': {
                'name': 'production',
                'domain': 'example.com'
            },
            '2':{
                'name': 'integration', # (optional)
                'domain': 'example.net'
            },
            '3': {
                'name': 'localhost', # development on local system (optional)
                'domain': 'localhost:8080'
            },
            '4':{
                'name': 'internal', # development on local or remote system such as headless vm!  (optional)
                'domain': '10.10.1.50:8080'
            }   
        }
        # -------------------------------
        * _ SITE_ID needs to be set to an index to one of the above fields in SITE_INFO
            + For the Production server set SITE_ID = "1"
            + For the Integration server set SITE_ID = "2"
            + For the Localhost server set SITE_ID = "3"
            + For a IP based server set SITE_ID = "4"
        * _ Any existing site objects with (pk= 1,2,3,4) will be updated with the relevant info set in SITE_INFO
        * _ Site creation will be skipped if SITE_INFO is not defined in your settings file

4. Automatically create a matching user profile ``anytime`` after each user creation if:
    A. Existence of USER_PROFILE_AUTO_CREATE = True in your settings file
    B. Existence of AUTH_PROFILE_MODULE = 'application.UserProfile' in your settings file
        * _ Example ``AUTH_PROFILE_MODULE = profile.UserProfile'``
    C. User profile creation will be skipped if:
        * _ USER_PROFILE_AUTO_CREATE is set to False or empty or not set in your settings file
        * _ AUTH_PROFILE_MODULE is empty, invalid or not set in your setting file
        * _ AUTH_PROFILE_MODULE points to an application and module that is incomplete or misconfigured
