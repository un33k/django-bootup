How to use
=================

    Follow the instructions in the ``Current Features`` section below for usage.
    Run syncdb and enjoy


Running the tests
=================

    To run the tests against the current environment:
    python manage.py test bootup


Current Features
=================

    1. Disable ``syncdb`` from prompting you to create a superuser

    2. Latch on the ``post_syncdb`` signal and execute the following:
        A. Install all ``fixture(s)`` found within a given path (single path)
            * - Path is set in your settings file as: BOOTUP_INITIAL_FIXTURES_DIRS
            * _ Any valid fixture file(s) at the above path will be installed
            * _ Fixture files(s) at the above path don't require to start with ``initial_``
            * _ Fixture installation will be skipped if no fixture file is found at the specified path
            * _ Fixture installation will be skipped if BOOTUP_INITIAL_FIXTURES_DIRS is not defined or empty
            * _ Warning: fixture(s) in this directory will be loaded after ``each`` syncdb and wipe your changes out

        B. Create or Update a superuser
            * - This superuser will be the first created user on your system
            * - Primary Key = ``1`` will be used to fetch and update existing superuser
            * - Superuser credentials have to be set in the project's settings file as follows:
              + BOOTUP_SUPERUSER_NAME = "desired name for the superuser"
              + BOOTUP_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD = "desired password for ``the`` superuser"
              + BOOTUP_SUPERUSER_EMAIL = "desired email address for the superuser"
            * _ Superuser creation/update will be skipped if:
              + Any of the three (above) credentials is undefined or empty

        C. Automatically create the required ``Site`` objects with proper ``name`` and ``domain`` if:
            * _ Existence of BOOTUP_SITES in your setting file with the following format
            # -------------------------------
            BOOTUP_SITES = {
                '1': {
                    'name': 'Example Inc',  # production site
                    'domain': 'example.com'
                },
                '2':{
                    'name': 'integration', # (optional)
                    'domain': 'example.net'
                },
                '3': {
                    'name': 'localhost', # development on local system (optional)
                    'domain': 'localhost:8080'
                },
                '4':{
                    'name': 'internal', # development on local or remote system such as headless vm!  (optional)
                    'domain': '10.10.1.50:8080'
                }   
            }
            # -------------------------------
            * _ SITE_ID needs to be set to an index to one of the above fields in BOOTUP_SITES
                + For the Production server set SITE_ID = "1"
                + For the Integration server set SITE_ID = "2"
                + For the Localhost server set SITE_ID = "3"
                + For a IP based server set SITE_ID = "4"
            * _ Any existing site objects with (pk= 1,2,3,4) will be updated with the relevant info set in BOOTUP_SITES
            * _ Site creation will be skipped if BOOTUP_SITES is not defined in your settings file

    4. Automatically create a matching user profile ``anytime`` after each user creation if:
        A. Existence of BOOTUP_USER_PROFILE_AUTO_CREATE = True in your settings file
        B. Existence of AUTH_PROFILE_MODULE = 'application.UserProfile' in your settings file
            * _ Example ``AUTH_PROFILE_MODULE = profile.UserProfile'``
        C. User profile creation will be skipped if:
            * _ BOOTUP_USER_PROFILE_AUTO_CREATE is set to False or empty or not set in your settings file
            * _ AUTH_PROFILE_MODULE is empty, invalid or not set in your setting file
            * _ AUTH_PROFILE_MODULE points to an application and module that is incomplete or misconfigured

    5. Automatically delete a matching user profile ``anytime`` after each user deletion if:
        A. Existence of BOOTUP_USER_PROFILE_AUTO_CREATE = True in your settings file
        B. Existence of BOOTUP_USER_PROFILE_AUTO_DELETE = True in your settings file
        C. Existence of AUTH_PROFILE_MODULE = 'application.UserProfile' in your settings file
            * _ Example ``AUTH_PROFILE_MODULE = profile.UserProfile'``
        D. User profile deletion will be skipped if:
            * _ BOOTUP_USER_PROFILE_AUTO_DELETE is set to False or empty or not set in your settings file
            * _ AUTH_PROFILE_MODULE is empty, invalid or not set in your setting file
            * _ AUTH_PROFILE_MODULE points to an application and module that is incomplete or misconfigured
